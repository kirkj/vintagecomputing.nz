## Buying Vintage Computers in NZ

The most active marketplace in NZ is the [Trademe Computers > Vintage](https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/marketplace/computers/vintage) section.

There are several hobbiests and small retailers offering accessories for vintage computers out of Aotearoa NZ. Many of them list their items on Trademe, but here are a couple that have their own web stores:

- [Monotech Vintage PCs](https://monotech.fwscart.com/) - Jacob Dorne's selection of hobbiest add-ons for IBM, Mac and other computers.
- [vRetro](https://www.vretrodesign.com/) and [vDriveZX](https://vdrivezx.com/) - Charlie Ingley's add-ons for Sinclair computers.
